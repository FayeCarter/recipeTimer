# Recipe Timer

The aim of this project is to design a chrome extension that will allow the user to display what time they will finish cooking a recipe.

## Current Status

![gif](/app.gif)

The app is a work in progress, current issue to resolve:
- [] the extension can only be opened while the page is loading. 

The next steps will be:
 - [] allow users to enter a start time and see what time they will finish
 - [] allow users to add end time to see what time they should start cooking

## How to install

* Clone github project
* In Chrome browser navigate to chrome://extensions/ 
* Select developer mode in the top right
* Select Load unpacked
* Select 'RecipeTimer' folder

## How to run
